4. **Content Creators**: Those looking to create interactive AI characters with distinctive personalities
5. **End Users**: People interacting with the agents through various interfaces

## User Experience Goals
1. **Natural Interaction**: Agents should communicate in a natural, conversational manner
2. **Consistency**: Agents should maintain consistent personalities and context awareness
3. **Tool Proficiency**: Agents should effectively use available tools to accomplish tasks
4. **Goal Orientation**: Agents should understand and work toward fulfilling user goals
5. **Adaptability**: Agents should adapt to different user needs and communication styles

## Key Features
1. **Runtime Loop Architecture**: A robust processing loop for receiving, processing, and responding to messages
2. **Agent Personalization System**: Framework for defining agent personalities and characteristics
3. **Tool Integration Framework**: System for connecting agents to external tools and services, including MCP server integration.
4. **Memory System**: Storage and retrieval mechanisms for maintaining conversation context
5. **Multi-client Support**: Ability to connect agents to various communication channels
6. **Evaluation System**: Mechanisms to assess and improve agent responses
7. **Asynchronous Processing**: Efficient handling of concurrent operations
8. **MCP Server Integration**: Support for connecting to and utilizing tools from MCP servers via the OpenAI Agent SDK.

## Success Metrics

2. **Response Quality**: Accuracy, helpfulness, and appropriateness of agent responses
3. **Conversation Coherence**: Ability to maintain context and coherent interactions over time
4. **Tool Usage Effectiveness**: How effectively agents utilize available tools
5. **Development Experience**: Ease with which developers can create and customize agents
6. **Performance Metrics**: Processing speed, memory usage, and scalability

## Constraints
1. **LLM Limitations**: Bounded by the capabilities of underlying language models
2. **API Dependencies**: Reliance on external APIs for certain functionalities
3. **Computational Resources**: Processing and memory requirements for agent operation
4. **Security Considerations**: Need to ensure agents operate within appropriate bounds
5. **Privacy Requirements**: Handling of user data and conversation history

## Related Systems
1. **OpenAI Agent SDK**: The foundational SDK upon which Carrier is built, providing core agent capabilities and MCP support.
2. **ElizaOS**: Node.js-based agent framework that inspired Carrier's runtime loop architecture.
3. **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with language models.
4. **AutoGPT**: Autonomous GPT-4 based agents.
5. **OpenAI Assistants API**: API for creating AI assistants with specific instructions.
6. **Semantic Kernel**: Framework for integrating AI services with programming languages.
7. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The open protocol used for standardized tool and context provision.

## Notes
The Carrier project is built upon the OpenAI Agent SDK and draws significant inspiration from ElizaOS's runtime loop architecture while implementing it in Python. This allows us to leverage Python's strengths in areas like asynchronous programming (asyncio), data validation (Pydantic), and web services (FastAPI) while utilizing the SDK's foundation for agent management and MCP integration.
