## Notes
The project has made significant progress with the implementation of the memory system and the initial integration of MCP servers. This provides a foundation for agents with context-aware interactions and access to a wider range of external tools via the standardized Model Context Protocol.

The MCP integration uses a centralized configuration file (`config/mcp_servers.json`) and manages server lifecycles efficiently in `run_agents.py`. Agents can now list their available tools, including those provided by MCP servers.

A new `AgentRuntime` (formerly `ContinuousRuntime`) has been implemented to enable proactive, goal-driven behavior based on SOPs defined in NocoDB, running alongside the existing reactive message loop. Initial data for the `TeslaFan` agent's `DailyNewsReport` SOP has been populated (though manual entry was required due to MCP tool issues). # Renamed

The next phase involves running the system and thoroughly testing the `AgentRuntime`'s execution logic using the populated NocoDB data. Continued development of the memory system and refinement of MCP integration (including debugging the NocoDB tool) remain parallel priorities. # Renamed
