## Notes
The project has made significant progress with the implementation of the memory system, which provides a foundation for context-aware agent interactions. The memory system uses Supabase with PostgreSQL and vector extensions for efficient semantic search, allowing agents to retrieve relevant memories based on content similarity.

The specialized memory managers (MessageManager, DescriptionManager, LoreManager, DocumentsManager, KnowledgeManager, RAGKnowledgeManager) provide tailored interfaces for different memory types, making it easier to work with specific kinds of memories. The memory hooks integrate conversation history with agent context, enabling more contextual responses.

The memory CLI tool provides a convenient interface for managing memories, allowing developers to list, clear, and test similarity search. The integration tests verify that the memory system works correctly with the agent runtime, ensuring that conversation history is properly used for context-aware responses.

The next phase will focus on optimizing the memory system for better performance, implementing more sophisticated memory management strategies, and integrating the memory system more deeply with the Discord and Instagram clients. This will enable more intelligent and context-aware agent interactions across different platforms.
