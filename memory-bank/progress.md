# Progress: Carrier

## What Works
* Memory bank structure established
* Core documentation files created with detailed content
* Project scope defined for autonomous AI Agents
* Runtime loop architecture adapted from ElizaOS to Python
* System architecture and component relationships defined
* Technical stack and dependencies identified
* Development setup documented
* Discord integration architecture designed and implemented
* Basic Agent runtime loop implemented with hooks for each processing stage
* Discord client integration using discord.py
* Agent memory system with conversation history storage
* CLI-based agent implementation (tifa_agent.py) for testing
* Character file loading and system prompt generation
* Agent integration with Discord message events
* Mention detection and handling in Discord

## What's Left to Build
* Discord client integration improvements:
  * Enhance Discord event handling for edge cases
  * Improve multi-agent support
  * Add channel-specific handling
  * Implement error recovery and reconnection logic
* Implementation of the Agent Runtime class
* Message Manager component for processing incoming messages
* State Manager for context composition
* Action Manager for tool execution
* Memory System for storing interactions
* Provider System for LLM integration
* Client interfaces for interacting with agents
* Tool integrations for agent capabilities
* Database schema for memory storage
* Testing framework for agent behavior validation

## Current Status
* Planning phase complete
* Architecture design complete
* Initial implementation phase in progress
* Core patterns and components defined and partially implemented
* Technical decisions documented and applied
* Discord integration implemented and ready for testing
* CLI agent implementation complete and working

## Known Issues
* Memory retrieval system needs optimization for long-term context
* Vector database integration for efficient semantic search still needed
* Testing LLM-based systems will require deterministic approaches
* Security considerations for tool usage need further development
* Discord rate limits need to be managed for high-traffic channels
* Multi-agent management complexity in shared Discord environments
* Error handling and recovery needs improvement
* Long-running Discord connections require reconnection strategies
* Agent memory persistence across restarts not yet implemented
* Logging infrastructure needs enhancement for production use

## Next Tasks
1. Test Discord integration with multiple character files
2. Implement more robust error handling in Discord client
3. Enhance agent memory system for better context handling
4. Add reconnection logic for Discord client
5. Set up development environment with recommended dependencies
6. Implement core data models using Pydantic
7. Create database schema for memory storage
8. Begin implementation of Agent Runtime class
9. Develop Message Manager component for processing messages

## Notes
The project has moved from planning to implementation, with significant progress in the Discord client integration. Both the discord_agent.py and tifa_agent.py implementations demonstrate the core runtime loop architecture in practice, with each component of the 7-step process implemented through Python code.

The Discord integration now serves as a working implementation of the agent runtime, allowing real-world testing with Discord users. This concrete implementation helps validate the architecture design and provides a foundation for further development of the core runtime components.

The next phase will focus on testing and refining the Discord integration, then extending the core runtime components to support more advanced features like sophisticated memory systems, enhanced context management, and expanded tool capabilities.
