## Notes
The project has moved from planning to implementation, with significant progress in both Discord and Instagram client integrations. The discord_agent.py, instagram_client.py, and tifa_agent.py implementations demonstrate the core runtime loop architecture in practice, with each component of the 7-step process implemented through Python code.

The Discord integration enables conversational interactions in chat channels, while the Instagram client provides media posting capabilities. Both integrations serve as working implementations of the agent runtime, allowing real-world testing with users. These concrete implementations help validate the architecture design and provide a foundation for further development of the core runtime components.

The multi-client architecture now established demonstrates the flexibility of the Carrier framework, allowing agents to interact through different channels while maintaining a consistent processing approach. The run_agent.py script shows how multiple clients can operate concurrently, with agents responding appropriately to different types of interactions.

The next phase will focus on testing and refining these client integrations, then extending the core runtime components to support more advanced features like sophisticated memory systems, enhanced context management, expanded tool capabilities, and improved media handling.
