## Next Steps
* Test the Discord and Instagram integrations with the Tifa character and assistantbot
* Refine the Discord and Instagram clients based on testing feedback
* Extend Discord integration to support multiple agents and channels
* Enhance Instagram client with additional media posting capabilities
* Implement error handling and reconnection logic for Instagram client
* Optimize FTP file upload process for Instagram media
* Begin implementation of additional Agent Runtime class features
* Develop the Message Manager component for more complex processing
* Create the State Manager for more comprehensive context composition
* Implement the Action Manager for expanded tool execution
* Design the Memory System for more sophisticated interaction storage
* Set up the Provider System for alternative LLM integration options

## Active Decisions
* Python will be the primary implementation language
* The runtime loop will follow the 7-step process outlined in projectbrief.md
* Async processing will be implemented using Python's asyncio
* Data validation will be handled by Pydantic models
* The API layer will be implemented using FastAPI
* Database storage will use SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL and vector extensions
* Discord integration uses discord.py library
* Instagram integration uses Instagram Graph API
* FTP server is used for media file uploads before Instagram posting
* Discord and Instagram clients run concurrently as background processes
* Agents respond when mentioned/tagged in Discord channels
* Instagram client provides media posting capabilities
* Discord and Instagram credentials are loaded from the existing .env file
* Agent memory is maintained using the AgentMemory dataclass
* Runtime hooks implement the 7-step process for message handling

## Current Considerations
* How to efficiently implement the memory retrieval system for context-aware responses
* The best approach for implementing tool validation and execution
* Performance optimization for handling concurrent agent instances
* Testing strategy for deterministic testing of LLM-based systems
* Security measures for agent tool usage and data privacy
* Efficient handling of Discord message events and rate limiting
* Multi-agent management for different Discord channels or servers
* Handling long-running Discord and Instagram connections and reconnection strategies
* Managing Discord and Instagram API rate limits in high-traffic environments
* Optimizing media file uploads for Instagram posting
* Handling Instagram API publishing limits and quotas
* Implementing robust error handling for Instagram media posting
* Optimizing memory storage for efficient context retrieval

## Notes
The project has moved from planning to implementation, with the core Discord and Instagram client integrations now in place. The discord_agent.py script implements the connection to Discord using discord.py, while the instagram_client.py script implements the connection to Instagram using the Instagram Graph API. The Agent class from the Carrier framework handles message processing and response generation for both clients.

The implementation follows the 7-step runtime loop outlined in the project brief, with each step mapped to specific components in the Python codebase. Runtime hooks are used to implement the various stages of message processing, action execution, evaluation, and memory storage.

The current implementation of Discord and Instagram integrations provides a strong foundation for further development of the Carrier framework, with the core agent runtime pattern now demonstrated in practical applications. The Discord client enables conversational interactions in chat channels, while the Instagram client provides media posting capabilities. The next steps will focus on refining these implementations and extending them to support more complex features like multi-agent management, advanced tool usage, and enhanced media handling.
