# Active Context: Carrier

## Current Focus
* Implementing the runtime loop architecture for autonomous AI Agents
* Adapting the ElizaOS patterns from Node.js to Python
* Establishing core architectural components
* Developing Discord client integration for autonomous agent interactions
* Testing and refining the Discord integration with different character files

## Recent Changes
* March 13, 2025: Created memory bank directory and initialized core documentation files
* March 13, 2025: Defined project scope for creating autonomous AI Agents
* March 13, 2025: Adapted ElizaOS runtime loop architecture to Python implementation
* March 13, 2025: Established technical context including technologies, dependencies, and development setup
* March 13, 2025: Defined system patterns and component relationships
* March 13, 2025: Updated development environment to use Anaconda virtual environment "carrier" with Python 3.9 instead of venv
* March 13, 2025: Planned Discord client integration for agents to autonomously interact in Discord channels
* March 14, 2025: Implemented discord_agent.py script for Discord integration using discord.py
* March 14, 2025: Created tifa_agent.py as a simpler CLI-based agent for testing
* March 14, 2025: Integrated Agent framework with Discord events for message processing

## Next Steps
* Test the Discord integration with the Tifa character and assistantbot
* Refine the Discord client based on testing feedback
* Extend Discord integration to support multiple agents and channels
* Begin implementation of additional Agent Runtime class features
* Develop the Message Manager component for more complex processing
* Create the State Manager for more comprehensive context composition
* Implement the Action Manager for expanded tool execution
* Design the Memory System for more sophisticated interaction storage
* Set up the Provider System for alternative LLM integration options

## Active Decisions
* Python will be the primary implementation language
* The runtime loop will follow the 7-step process outlined in projectbrief.md
* Async processing will be implemented using Python's asyncio
* Data validation will be handled by Pydantic models
* The API layer will be implemented using FastAPI
* Database storage will use SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL and vector extensions
* Discord integration uses discord.py library
* Discord agents run as background processes listening for events
* Agents respond when mentioned/tagged in Discord channels
* Discord credentials are loaded from the existing .env file
* Agent memory is maintained using the AgentMemory dataclass
* Runtime hooks implement the 7-step process for message handling

## Current Considerations
* How to efficiently implement the memory retrieval system for context-aware responses
* The best approach for implementing tool validation and execution
* Performance optimization for handling concurrent agent instances
* Testing strategy for deterministic testing of LLM-based systems
* Security measures for agent tool usage and data privacy
* Efficient handling of Discord message events and rate limiting
* Multi-agent management for different Discord channels or servers
* Handling long-running Discord connections and reconnection strategies
* Managing Discord API rate limits in high-traffic environments
* Optimizing memory storage for efficient context retrieval

## Notes
The project has moved from planning to implementation, with the core Discord client integration now in place. The discord_agent.py script implements the connection to Discord using discord.py, and the Agent class from the Carrier framework handles message processing and response generation.

The implementation follows the 7-step runtime loop outlined in the project brief, with each step mapped to specific components in the Python codebase. Runtime hooks are used to implement the various stages of message processing, action execution, evaluation, and memory storage.

The current implementation of Discord integration provides a strong foundation for further development of the Carrier framework, with the core agent runtime pattern now demonstrated in a practical application. The next steps will focus on refining the implementation and extending it to support more complex features like multi-agent management and advanced tool usage.
