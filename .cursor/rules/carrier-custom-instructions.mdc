### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read the memory bank files under `/memory-bank/` starting with `.clinerules`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `activeContext.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `.clinerules`.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 800 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `activeContext.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `activeContext.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

### üìé Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `activeContext.md`.

- **Prioritize new features in Python 3.10+.**
- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file name.**
- **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while still being efficient.**
- **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
- **Use the most modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
- **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable without requiring extensive modifications.**
- **If a request is unclear or lacks sufficient information, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
- **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
- **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**

- **Before attempting to insert data into a Nocodb table, first get the table's schema with nocodb MCP's get_schema(tablename).  That way the data types being inserted can be validated and properly formatted.**
- **Do not put any comments in JSON!**
- **If you need to search for information or aren't sure about something, use the Brave Search MCP**
